She went to the playground, grabbed a kid, took him behind a tree, and told him, \"I`ve kidnapped you.\" She then wrote a note saying, \"I`ve kidnapped your kid. Tomorrow morning, put $10,000 in a paper bag and put it under the pecan tree next to the slide on the north side of the playground.

The next morning the blonde checked, and sure enough, a paper bag was sitting beneath the pecan tree.  The blonde opened the bag and found the $10,000 with a note that said, \"How could you do this to a fellow Blonde?\"",

She wanted a pair of genuine alligator shoes in the worst way, but was very reluctant to pay the high prices the local vendors were asking. \nAfter becoming very frustrated with the \"no haggle\" attitude of one of the shopkeepers, the blonde shouted, \"Maybe I'll just go out and catch my own alligator so I can get a pair of shoes at a reasonable price!\" \nThe shopkeeper said, \"By all means, be my guest. Maybe you'll luck out and catch yourself a big one!\" \nDetermined, the blonde turned and headed for the swamps, set on catching herself an alligator. \nLater in the day, the shopkeeper was driving home, when he spotted the young woman standing waist deep in the water, shotgun in hand. Just then, he saw a huge 9-foot alligator swimming quickly toward her. She took aim, killed the creature, and with a great deal of effort hauled it on to the swamp bank. \nLying nearby were several more of the dead creatures. The shopkeeper watched in amazement. Just then the blonde flipped the alligator on its back, and frustrated, shouted out, \"Damn it, this one isn't wearing any shoes either!\"",

The detective conducting the interview looked at the three of them and said, \"So you all want to be a cop, eh?\"The blondes all nodded. The detective got up, opened a file drawer and pulled out a file folder. Sitting back down, he opened it up and withdrew a photograph, and said, \"To be a detect, you have to be able to DETECT. You must be able to notice things such as distinguishing features and oddities such as scars, etc.\" So saying, he stuck the photo in the face of the first blonde and withdrew it after about 2 seconds. \"Now, he said, \"Did you notice any distinguishing features about this man?\"The blonde immediately said, \"Yes, I did. He only has one eye!\"The detective shook his head and said, \"Of COURSE he only has one eye in this picture! It's a PROFILE of his face! You're dismissed!\"The first blonde hung her head and walked out of the office. The detective then turned to the second blonde, stuck the photo in her face for two seconds, pulled it back and said, \"What about you? Notice anything unusual or outstanding about this man?\"The blonde immediately shot back, \"Yep! He only has one ear!\"The detective put his head in his hand and exclaimed, \"Didn't you hear what I just said to the other lady? This is a PROFILE of the man's face! Of COURSE you can only see one ear!! You're excused, too! You'd never make a good detective!\"The second blonde sheepishly walked out of the office.The detective turn his attention to the last blonde and said, \"This is probably a waste of time, but....\". He flashed the photo in her face for a couple of seconds and withdrew it, saying, \"Alright. Did YOU notice anything distinguishing or unusual about this man?\"The blonde said, \"Yes, I did. This man wears contact lenses.\"The detective frowned, took another look at the picture and began looking at some of the papers in the folder. He looked up at the blonde with a puzzled expression and said, \"You're absolutely right! His bio says he wears contacts! How in the world could tell that by looking at this picture?\"The blonde rolled her eyes and said, \"DUH! He has only one eye and one ear, he certainly CAN'T WEAR GLASSES!\"",

He comes back just a few minutes later, and you can hear the horse laughing all the way inside. The man takes his money and leaves. About a year later, he goes back to the bar, and they've got another jar of twenties there. \"What's the deal now?\" He asks. \"Well\",the bartender says,\"That damn horse won't stop laughing! So the first person who can make my horse stop laughing wins the money!\" The man pays his twenty, and goes out to the stable. He returns a few minutes later, and the horse is bawling his eyes out. He picks up his money and is about to leave when the bartender stops him. \"Alright\", he says,\"You have won an awful lot of money from me and I want to know how you did it!!\" \"Easy\", he says,\"I made him laugh by saying mine was bigger than his, and I made him cry by proving it!!\"",

        "body": "An 85 year old couple, having been married almost 60 years, had died in a car crash. They had been in good health the last ten years mainly due to her interest in health food, and exercise. When they reached the pearly gates, St. Peter took them to their mansion which was decked out with a beautiful kitchen and master bath suite and Jacuzzi. As they \"oohed and aahed\" the old man asked Peter how much all this was going to cost.\"It's free,\" Peter replied, \"this is Heaven.\"Next they went out back to survey the championship golf course that the home backed up to. They would have golfing privileges everyday and each week the course changed to a new one representing the great golf courses on earth. The old man asked, \"what are the green fees?\"Peter's reply, \"This is heaven, you play for free.\"Next they went to the club house and saw the lavish buffet lunch with the cuisine's of the world laid out.\"How much to eat?\" asked the old man. \"Don't you understand yet? This is heaven, it is free!\" Peter replied with some exasperation.\"Well, where are the low fat and low cholesterol tables?\" the old man asked timidly.Peter lectured, \"That's the best part . . . you can eat as much as you like of whatever you like and you never get fat and you never get sick. This is Heaven.\"With that the old man went into a fit of anger, throwing down his hat and stomping on it, and shrieking wildly.Peter and his wife both tried to calm him down, asking him what was wrong.The old man looked at his wife and said, \"This is all your fault. If it weren't for your bran muffins, I could have been here ten years ago!\"",

        "body": "A concerned husband went to a doctor to talk about his wife. He says to the doctor, \"Doctor, I think my wife is deaf because she never hears me the first time and always asks me to repeat things.\" \"Well,\" the doctor replied, \"go home and tonight stand about 15 feet from her and say something to her. If she doesn't reply move about 5 feet close and say itagain. Keep doing this so that we'll get an idea about the severity of her deafness\". Sure enough, the husband goes home and does exactly as instructed. He starts off about 15 feet from his wife in the kitchen as she is chopping some vegetables and says, \"Honey, what's for dinner?\" He hears no response. He moves about 5 feet closer and asks again. No reply. He moves 5 feet closer. Still no reply. He gets fed up and moves right behind her, about an inch away, and asks again, \"Honey, what's for dinner?\" She replies, \"For the fourth time, vegetable stew!\"",
